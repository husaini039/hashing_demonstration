# Hashing Demonstration Project

This project demonstrates the workings of various cryptographic hash functions, including **MD5**, **SHA-1**, and **SHA-256**. It also shows how adding **salt** to SHA-256 can help randomize the hash output, along with controlling the **number of rounds** for added security.

## Features

- **MD5**: Example of MD5 hashing algorithm and its output.
- **SHA-1**: Example of SHA-1 hashing algorithm and its output.
- **SHA-256**: Example of SHA-256 hashing algorithm and its output.
- **Salting SHA-256**: Adds salt to SHA-256 to randomize the output and makes it more secure.
- **Number of Rounds**: Configurable number of rounds to apply hashing for added complexity.

## How to Use
